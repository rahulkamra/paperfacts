This setup works fine with a basic PizzaService function from client.

It fails with a 'Channel Disconnected' error when using the LoginService from the client (commited in the client branch).


Error Details : 

Failure : [RPC Fault faultString="Channel disconnected" faultCode="Client.Error.DeliveryInDoubt" faultDetail="Channel disconnected before an acknowledgement was received"]
